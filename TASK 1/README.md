# Classical Ciphers in Java 🔐  

## Description  
This repository contains Java implementations of four classical encryption techniques: **Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Playfair Cipher,** and **Hill Cipher**. These algorithms demonstrate fundamental cryptographic principles used in text encryption.  

## Technologies Used 🚀  
- **Java** – Core implementation  
- **String Manipulation** – Text transformations and encryption logic  
- **Data Structures** – HashMaps, Matrices for key handling  
- **Mathematical Operations** – Matrix multiplication (Hill Cipher)  

## Implemented Ciphers  
✔ **Caesar Cipher** – Shifts letters by a fixed number  
✔ **Monoalphabetic Cipher** – Uses a substitution mapping  
✔ **Playfair Cipher** – Encrypts digraphs using a 5x5 matrix  
✔ **Hill Cipher** – Uses matrix multiplication for encryption  

## How to Run  
1. **Clone** the repo:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SanyaShresta25/Information-and-Network-Security.git  
   cd Information-and-Network-Security 
   ```  
2. **Compile and Run** any cipher:  
   ```sh
   javac CipherName.java  
   java CipherName  
   ```  

## Notes 📝  
- Works with uppercase letters only (except Monoalphabetic)  
- Some ciphers require key matrices or predefined mappings  
- Decryption logic is not included in all implementations
