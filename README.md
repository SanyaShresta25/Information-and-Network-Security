# 🔐 Classical Ciphers in Java  

## 📜 Description  
This repository contains Java implementations of **six** classical encryption techniques: **Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Playfair Cipher, Hill Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, RSA Cipher, Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and Feistel Cipher**. These algorithms demonstrate fundamental cryptographic principles used in text encryption.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
✅ **Java** – Core implementation  
✅ **String Manipulation** – Text transformations and encryption logic  
✅ **Data Structures** – HashMaps, Matrices for key handling  
✅ **Mathematical Operations** – Matrix multiplication (Hill Cipher), Modular arithmetic (RSA, Diffie-Hellman)  

## 🔒 Implemented Ciphers  
✔ **Caesar Cipher** – Shifts letters by a fixed number  
✔ **Monoalphabetic Cipher** – Uses a substitution mapping  
✔ **Playfair Cipher** – Encrypts digraphs using a 5x5 matrix  
✔ **Hill Cipher** – Uses matrix multiplication for encryption  
✔ **Vigenère Cipher** – Uses a keystream for polyalphabetic substitution  
✔ **RSA Cipher** – Asymmetric encryption using modular exponentiation  
✔ **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** – Securely exchanges cryptographic keys  
✔ **Feistel Cipher** – Block cipher structure for encryption and decryption  

## 🛠 How to Run  
1️⃣ **Clone the repo:**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanyaShresta25/Information-and-Network-Security.git  
cd Information-and-Network-Security  
```  
2️⃣ **Compile and Run any cipher:**  
```bash
javac CipherName.java  
java CipherName  
```  

## 📝 Notes  
⚡ Works with uppercase letters only (except Monoalphabetic and Vigenère)  
⚡ Some ciphers require key matrices or predefined mappings  
⚡ Decryption logic is not included in all implementations
