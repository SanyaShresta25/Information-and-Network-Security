# 🔐 Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange in Python  

## 📜 Description  
This Python program implements the **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** algorithm, a cryptographic method for securely exchanging a shared secret between two parties over an insecure channel.  

## ✨ Features  
✅ Uses a **prime number (q)** as the modulus.  
✅ Uses a **primitive root (a)** of the prime number.  
✅ Each party (A & B) selects a **private key**.  
✅ Computes **public keys** using modular exponentiation.  
✅ Derives a **shared secret key** using the public keys.  

## ⚙️ How It Works  
1. The user enters a **prime number (q)** and a **primitive root (a)**.  
2. Each party (A & B) selects a **private key (Xa, Xb)**.  
3. Public keys **(Ya, Yb)** are computed using:  
   \[
   Y = a^X \mod q
   \]  
4. The shared secret key **(K)** is derived by both parties using:  
   \[
   K = Y^X \mod q
   \]  
5. Both parties end up with the **same shared key (Ka = Kb)**.  

## 🛠 Code Explanation  
🔢 **Input:** Prime number (q), primitive root (a), and private keys (Xa, Xb).  
🔑 **Public Key Generation:** Uses modular exponentiation to compute public keys.  
🔐 **Shared Key Computation:** Each party computes the shared key using the other’s public key.  

## 🎯 Example Run  
**Input:**  
```bash
Enter a prime number: 23
Enter a primitive root: 5
Enter the private key of A: 6
Enter the private key of B: 15
```
**Output:**  
```bash
Public key of A: 8.0
Public key of B: 19.0
Shared key for A: 2.0
Shared key for B: 2.0
```

## 🖥 Requirements  
🐍 **Python 3.x** installed.  
📝 A text editor or an IDE like **VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook**.  

## ⚠️ Notes  
⚡ The program currently uses **floating-point values** for exponentiation. To ensure accuracy, consider using **integer-based modular exponentiation (pow(base, exp, mod))**.  
⚡ The shared key must be the **same for both parties**; if not, check input values.
