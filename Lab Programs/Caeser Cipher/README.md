# 🔐 Caesar Cipher in Java

## 📜 Description
This Java program implements the **Caesar Cipher** encryption and decryption techniques. The program allows users to enter a plaintext message and a shift value, which determines how many positions each letter in the text will be shifted in the alphabet.

## ✨ Features
-  Encrypts a given text using the Caesar cipher technique.
-  Decrypts the ciphered text back to its original form.
-  Works for both uppercase and lowercase letters.
-  Maintains spaces in the original text.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The user provides a plaintext message.
2. The user specifies a shift value (key) for the encryption.
3. The program encrypts the plaintext using the Caesar cipher.
4. The encrypted text is displayed.
5. The program then decrypts the encrypted text using the same shift value.
6. The decrypted text (original message) is displayed.

## 🛠 Code Explanation
- 🔐 `encrypt(String plaintext, int shift)`: Encrypts the given text by shifting characters forward in the alphabet.
- 🔓 `decrypt(String ciphertext, int shift)`: Decrypts the given text by shifting characters backward in the alphabet.
- 🎯 `main(String[] args)`: Handles user input, calls the encryption and decryption methods, and prints results.

## 💡 Example Run
**Input:**
```
Enter the plaintext: hello world
Enter the shift value: 3
```

**Output:**
```
Cipher text is: khoor zruog
Decrypted text is: hello world
```

## 🖥 Requirements
- ☕ Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- 🖊 A text editor or an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. 📂 Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/CaesarCipher.git
   cd CaesarCipher
   ```
2. 🏗 Compile the program:
   ```sh
   javac CaesarCipher.java
   ```
3. ▶️ Run the program:
   ```sh
   java CaesarCipher
   ```
4. 🖥 Follow the on-screen prompts to enter text and shift values.

## ⚠️ Notes
- The program only shifts alphabetical characters; spaces remain unchanged.
- The shift value should be a positive integer.
- The decryption process reverses the shift to retrieve the original message.
